## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I saw a lot of the links between the images and the media queries via html in <img>.

```html
 <img srcset="images/image-product-desktop.jpg 600w, images/image-product-mobile.jpg 686w"
        sizes="(max-width: 600px) 686px, 300px" src="images/image-product-desktop.jpg" alt="A bottle of perfume">
```
```css
@media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {
    section {
        flex-direction: column;
        width: 300px;
    }
    .prices {
        margin-top: -1px;
        margin-bottom: 10px;
    }

    img {
        width: 100%;
        border-top-left-radius: 20px;
        border-top-right-radius: 20px;
        border-bottom-left-radius: 0px;
       }
  }
```

### Continued development

The things I want to improve and review are the media queries, during this challenge I saw that there were several (@media, @media only, @media screen).
